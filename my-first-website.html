                <p>
                Istiak Tanvir is both a software engineer and a front-end developer, with a diverse range of skillsincluding React, Flutter, Python, Java, and TypeScript. <br> <br>The website is personal, leaning heavily into the programmer aesthetic, including a dark-theme withfaint integrated development environment (IDE) code in the background. Subtle animations encouragevisitors to scroll down the page through a gallery of skills and past work. <br> <br>
                One key thing to notice is how the portfolio includes a lot of past projects. Instead of using ageneric collage of projects, Tamal Sen shows off UX skills by highlighting a featured project firstand varying the sizes of project screenshots for past work.

            <p>
                Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); <br> <br>Search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.<br> <br>
                The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.
